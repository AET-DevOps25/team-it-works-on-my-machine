# Workflow Genie - AI Powered CI/CD Analyzer

Supercharge your CI/CD workflows with AI. This tool harnesses the power of Generative AI, RAG, and static analysis to understand, audit, and optimize GitHub Actions like never before. Whether you're debugging a flaky pipeline, onboarding to a new repo, or scaling DevOps across teamsâ€”this assistant delivers instant, intelligent insights to level up your automation game.

This project is currently deployed on both [Kubernetes](https://workflow-genie.student.k8s.aet.cit.tum.de/) and [AWS](https://client.52.44.166.222.nip.io/)(probably offline right now, since running it costs money)

Each deployment is actively monitored. You can view real-time metrics and logs via the Grafana dashboards(Dashboards from imported from https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/) for [Kubernetes](https://monitoring-womm.student.k8s.aet.cit.tum.de/grafana/login) and [AWS](https://grafana.52.44.166.222.nip.io).
