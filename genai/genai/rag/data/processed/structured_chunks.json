This is great for developers, who can spend more time writing code and less time debugging errors or resolving merge conflicts.",

Similarly, be cautious when using self-hosted runners on private or internal repositories, as anyone who can fork the repository and open a pull request (generally those with read access to the repository) are able to compromise the self-hosted runner environment, including gaining access to secrets and theGITHUB_TOKENwhich, depending on its settings, can grant write access to the repository.

      "Some customers might attempt to partially mitigate these risks by implementing systems that automatically destroy the self-hosted runner after each job execution. However, this approach might not be as effective as intended, as there is no way to guarantee that a self-hosted runner only runs one job. Some jobs will use secrets as command-line arguments which can be seen by another job running on the same runner, such asps x -w. This can lead to secret leakages.",

This is particularly useful when you have a complete CI/CD process that you want to use across multiple repositories. Reusable workflows can be centrally maintained, in one location, but used in many repositories across your organization.",

Composite actions allow you refactor long YAML workflow files into much smaller files and avoid copying and pasting between workflow files.",

Therefore, if the steps must be run on a type of machine that might be different from the machine chosen for the calling workflow job, then you should use a reusable workflow, not a composite action.",

Reusable workflows are called directly within a job, and not from within a job step.

      "This section briefly describes some of the advanced features of GitHub Actions that help you create more complex workflows.",
      "If your workflows use sensitive data, such as passwords or certificates, you can save these in GitHub assecretsand then use them in your workflows as environment variables. This means that you will be able to create and share workflows without having to embed sensitive values directly in the workflow's YAML source.",
      "This example job demonstrates how to reference an existing secret as an environment variable, and send it as a parameter to an example command.",
      "For more information, seeUsing secrets in GitHub Actions.",
      "By default, the jobs in your workflow all run in parallel at the same time. If you have a job that must only run after another job has completed, you can use theneedskeyword to create this dependency. If one of the jobs fails, all dependent jobs are skipped; however, if you need the jobs to continue, you can define this using theifconditional statement.",
      "In this example, thesetup,build, andtestjobs run in series, withbuildandtestbeing dependent on the successful completion of the job that precedes them:",
      "For more information, seeUsing jobs in a workflow.",
      "A matrix strategy lets you use variables in a single job definition to automatically create multiple job runs that are based on the combinations of the variables. For example, you can use a matrix strategy to test your code in multiple versions of a language or on multiple operating systems. The matrix is created using thestrategykeyword, which receives the build options as an array. For example, this matrix will run the job multiple times, using different versions of Node.js:",
      "For more information, seeRunning variations of jobs in a workflow.",
      "If your jobs regularly reuse dependencies, you can consider caching these files to help improve performance. Once the cache is created, it is available to all workflows in the same repository.",
      "This example demonstrates how to cache the~/.npmdirectory:",
      "For more information, seeCaching dependencies to speed up workflows.",
      "If your job requires a database or cache service, you can use theserviceskeyword to create an ephemeral container to host the service; the resulting container is then available to all steps in that job and is removed when the job has completed. This example demonstrates how a job can useservicesto create apostgrescontainer, and then usenodeto connect to the service.",
      "For more information, seeUsing containerized services.",
      "If you want to be sure that a particular type of runner will process your job, you can use labels to control where jobs are executed. You can assign labels to a self-hosted runner in addition to their default label ofself-hosted. Then, you can refer to these labels in your YAML workflow, ensuring that the job is routed in a predictable way. GitHub-hosted runners have predefined labels assigned.",
      "This example shows how a workflow can use labels to specify the required runner:",
      "A workflow will only run on a runner that has all the labels in theruns-onarray. The job will preferentially go to an idle self-hosted runner with the specified labels. If none are available and a GitHub-hosted runner with the specified labels exists, the job will go to a GitHub-hosted runner.",

You can use GitHub's built-in features to ensure you are notified about vulnerabilities in the actions you consume, or to automate the process of keeping the actions in your workflows up to date. For more information, seeUsing GitHub's security features to secure your use of GitHub Actions.",
      "You can configure environments with protection rules and secrets to control the execution of jobs in a workflow. Each job in a workflow can reference a single environment.
